# datafun-07-ml
A Predictive Machine Learning Project

This project is for the Data Analytics Fundamentals graduate-level CS course at Northwest Missouri State University, 2025. 

Project 7 is a chance to explore applied data analytics, offering a preliminary introduction to more advanced topics in the field.
This project offers a guided introduction to several key areas in data analytics. It's an opportunity to apply your skills and try an area that you might enjoy.  Many of these areas are covered in more depth in subsequent courses.

You have the flexibility to choose from several application areas, each offering a glimpse into different aspects of data analytics:

1. ML. Basic Machine Learning (ML): Explore fundamental ML concepts using Python's statistical and visualization libraries with simple linear regression and predictive analytics.

1. App. Interactive Analytics App using Shiny for Python: Get introduced to creating interactive web applications with Shiny for Python. This choice focuses on building basic interactive tools for data analysis.

Later (or propose a project):

1. SQL. Applied SQL Project: Engage in an applied SQL project integrating Python and SQLite. This option focuses on database interactions and SQL for data manipulation and querying.

1. NLP. Web Mining and Natural Language Processing (NLP): Delve into the basics of web mining and NLP using Python's NLTK library. This area will allow you to explore text processing and extraction of information from web sources.

Each of these areas represents a critical component of data analytics, and this project guides you through applying these concepts in a practical setting.
The goal is not mastery; it's to gain a basic understanding and appreciation of their role and potential in the field of data analytics and learn where you might want to focus your efforts in the future.

The specification is similar to early projects, but you'll need to tailor it to your chosen area.

1. Will you use a Jupyter Notebook or a Python script?
2. What tools and libraries will you use?
3. What dependencies will you need to install in your project virtual environment?
4. How will you organize your project?
5. How will you manage your project with Git?
6. How will you document your tools, process, code, and project?
